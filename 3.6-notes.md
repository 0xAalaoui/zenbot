## zenbrain collections

`ticks` - shared between apps, data key is prefixed
`logs` - tagged with app, feed
`thoughts` - shared between apps, key is prefixed
`run_states` - should be more ephemeral? should allow continuation/resuming of session? key is prefixed with app, optional --rs, should allow linking/heirarchy of run_states?

### zenbrain user stories

- an app should be able to access reduced tick data (and run_states?) from another app, from either the mapper, reducer, runner, or sim.
